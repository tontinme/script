dhcpd.conf configuration

DESCRIPTION
===========
	dhcpd.conf 包换dhcpd的配置信息
	dhcpd.conf is a free-form ASCII text file
	client启动时，依次读取dhcpd.conf中的host,class,pool,subnet,shared-network。
		如果parameters被声明超过一次，声明最具体的将被使用，即从左到右优先级依次降低
EXAMPLES

	subnet 204.254.239.0 netmask 255.255.255.224 {
	  subnet-specific parameters...
	  range 204.254.239.10 204.254.239.30;
	}
	
	subnet 204.254.239.32 netmask 255.255.255.224 {

	}
	
	group {
	  group-specific parameters...
	  host zappo.test.isc.org {
	    host-specific parameters...
	  }
	  host beppo.test.isc.org {
	    host-specific parameters...

	  host harpo.test.isc.org {
	    host-specific parameters...
	  }
	}
ADDRESS POOL
============
	the pool declaration can be used to specify a pool of addresses that will be treated different than another pool of addresses, even on
		the same network segment or subnet
	address pools exist at the level of shared networks, so address rangse within pool declarations can
		be on different subnets
	pools can have permit lists that control which clients are allowed access to the pool and which aren't. Each entry in a pool's permit 
		list is introduced with the allow or deny keyword
DYNAMIC ADDRESS ALLOCATION
==========================
	address allocation is autually only done when a client is in the INIT state and has sent a DHCPDISCOVER message. 
	the server has only three choices - it can ignore the DHCPREQUEST,send a DHCPNAK to tell the client it should stop using the address, 
		or send a DHCPACK, telling the client to go ahead and use the address for a while
